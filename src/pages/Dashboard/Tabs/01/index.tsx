          Chocolate is a preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is
          made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, which may also be
          used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. The earliest signs of
          use are associated with Olmec sites (within what would become Mexico’s
          post-colonial territory) suggesting consumption of chocolate
          beverages, dating from the 19th century BC.[1][2] The majority of
          Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and
          Aztecs.[3] The English word chocolate comes, via Spanish, from the
          Classical Nahuatl word xocolātl.
